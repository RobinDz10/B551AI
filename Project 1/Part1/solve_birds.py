# solve_birds.py : Bird puzzle solver
#
#
# Based on skeleton code by D. Crandall & B551 course staff, Fall 2022
#
# N birds stand in a row on a wire, each wearing a t-shirt with a number.
# In a single step, two adjacent birds can swap places. How can
# they rearrange themselves to be in order from 1 to N in the fewest
# possible steps?

#####
# THE ABSTRACTION:
#
# Initial state:

# Goal state:
# given a state, returns True or False to indicate if it is the goal state
def is_goal(state):
    return state == list(range(1, N+1))

# Successor function:
# given a state, return a list of successor states
def successors(state):
    return [ state[0:n] + [state[n+1],] + [state[n],] + state[n+2:] for n in range(0, N-1) ]

# Heuristic function:
# given a state, return the heuristic value of current state
# The heuristic value in here is defined as the missed placed birds
# Since the maximum Î”h could be 2 in here, I decide to divide the result by 2, therefore the heuristic value of each successor state would be admissible 
def h(state):
    num = 0
    for i in range(len(state)):
        if state[i] != i + 1:
            num += 1
    return num / 2

#
# THE ALGORITHM:
#
# This is a generic solver using BFS.
# Also, instead of using a traditional queue, I choose to use priority queue (min heap)
